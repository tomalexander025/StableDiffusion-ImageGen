# StableDiffusion-ImageGen

StableDiffusion-ImageGen | Ayush Sharma Project
Project Overview
StableDiffusion-ImageGen is an interactive web application that allows users to generate images based on a text prompt using the power of Stable Diffusion, a model provided by Stability AI. This project is designed to showcase how text-to-image generation works, with users being able to customize various parameters, such as the number of inference steps and the guidance scale. The app also integrates a feature to select different GPT models (gpt-2 or gpt-3.5) to assist in generating creative prompts for the image.

The app connects to Hugging Face's Stable Diffusion 2 model through their API. Users can input their Hugging Face API token, enter a prompt, and adjust image generation settings to receive a custom-generated image.

Features
Text-to-Image Generation: Generate unique images based on user-inputted text prompts.
API Integration: Uses the Hugging Face API to access the Stable Diffusion model.
Customizable Parameters: Adjust the number of steps and guidance scale to fine-tune the image.
GPT Model Selection: Choose between GPT-2 and GPT-3.5 to generate more creative or advanced prompts.
Responsive Design: The app is styled with a clean UI for ease of use, incorporating interactive elements such as input fields, sliders, and buttons.
Technologies Used
HTML, CSS, JavaScript: Core web technologies to build the UI and handle user interactions.
Stable Diffusion (via Hugging Face API): AI model used for generating images.
GPT Models: Text generation capabilities to assist with creating image prompts.
Usage
Clone or download this repository.
Open the index.html file in your browser.
Enter your Hugging Face API token.
Input a prompt for the image generation, and adjust settings (steps and guidance scale) if needed.
Click "Generate Image" to create a custom image.
About the Developer
My name is Ayush Sharma, and I'm a beginner in the field of Data Science, Machine Learning, and AI. I'm passionate about learning and building new things, and this project is one of my first attempts to dive deeper into AI-driven tools. Iâ€™ve developed this app as part of my journey to explore the world of AI Image Generation and familiarize myself with API integrations, prompt engineering, and frontend development.
